    "A research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, has set up a Minecraft server to explore how people play and develop interest in video games. However, to fully understand the financial and technical needs of this project, the researchers must know which kinds of players are likely to join the server and how many resources these users will occupy. The following analysis aims to answer the research group’s broad question of “What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?” More specifically, our analysis explores if number of sessions, total number of played hours, and mean session duration can be used to predict if players will subscribe to a game-related newsletter as well as the potential variations between experience level."

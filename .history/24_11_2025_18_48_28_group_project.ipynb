    "A research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, has set up a Minecraft server to explore how people play and develop interest in video games. However, to fully understand the financial and technical needs of this project, the researchers must know which kinds of players are likely to join the server and how many resources these users will occupy. The following analysis aims to answer the research group’s broad question of “What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?” More specifically, our analysis explores if number of sessions, total number of played hours, and mean session duration can be used to predict if players will subscribe to a game-related newsletter as well as the potential variations between experience level."

    "### Summmary Statistics\n",
    "​​The code selects the quantitative variables from the combined_data dataset (Age, played_hours, and average_session_length) so that summary statistics can be calculated. It then computes several descriptive statistics for each variable,including the mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, first quartile, third quartile, and standard deviation, while removing missing values. A small helper function is used to calculate the mode by counting the most frequent value. All statistics are then combined into a tidy summary table called players_data_stats, which organizes the statistics into labeled rows and relocates them so that “Summary” appears first before the numerical columns."

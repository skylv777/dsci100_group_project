    "A research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, has set up a Minecraft server to explore how people play and develop interest in video games. However, to fully understand the financial and technical needs of this project, the researchers must know which kinds of players are likely to join the server and how many resources these users will occupy. The following analysis aims to answer the research group’s broad question of “What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?” More specifically, our analysis explores if number of sessions, total number of played hours, and mean session duration can be used to predict if players will subscribe to a game-related newsletter as well as the potential variations between gender."

    "#### Summary\n",
    "To answer our specific question of \"Can hours played, age, and average session length predict whether a user is subscribed to a game-related newsletter?\" we utilized KNN classification. We examined potential variations in subscription status through visualizations.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Using our model that was tuned off the training data, we found an accuracy of 74.19% when used to predict on the testing data. However, this was due to the model predicting only `True` values and the class imbalance between the subscribed and not subscribed. Therefore this model is not sufficient to predict user's subscription status.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In an effort to fix this we balanced the data. Unfortunately, this model is also not sufficient to predict user's subscription status. The model tuned with the balanced training data was 58% accurate on the testing data which is worse than the 73.55% accuracy found of the majority classifier. It incorrectly classified 46.67% of the subscribed players as not subscribed. However, it accurately predicted which users were not subscribed. This indicates that the model trained with the oversampled data is more useful than our previous model.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Overall, through our models we were unable to predict subscription status based on different variables for the users in the dataset. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In relation to gender, there is a very unequal distribution of genders as the users are male dominated. The visuals created led to no clear evidence that gender has any effect on subscription status. The differences in *figure 12* are most likely due to lack of equal gender sampling. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  *and found unclear results in relation to the effect of gender on subscription. This information gives more insight into the characteristics and behaviours that are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter.* In addition, the visualizations and analysis allowed for relationships between the variables to be determined and to better understand how they differ based on the player."

    "#### Expectations vs Findings\n",
    "Before building our classifier, we expected the three behavioural variables—total hours played, age, and average session length—to contribute differently to predicting subscription status. Our exploratory plots suggested that players with higher total playtime and longer average sessions were slightly more likely to be subscribed, so we anticipated these two engagement-related variables would provide stronger predictive value. In contrast, we expected age to have a weaker effect, since most players across age groups accumulated relatively low total hours.\n",
    "For the secondary question of whether these patterns differ by gender, we expected any differences to be small, and we were unsure whether the heavily male-dominated dataset would allow for a meaningful comparison.\n",
    "After training and tuning the K-NN classifier, our findings largely aligned with these expectations. The model achieved an accuracy of 74.19%, and the playtime-related variables appeared more informative than age, which showed weaker and less consistent trends in the visualizations. Regarding gender, we found no meaningful difference in subscription patterns, with similar subscriber proportions for male and female players. Overall, the behavioural variables produced a reasonably accurate model, while gender did not appear to influence subscription outcomes in this dataset."

    "If we assume that players who are subscribed to game-related newletter are generally more interesting in recieving information about video games. Therefore, if a company can predict subscription, they can also build an email list that target those most likely to participate in competitions or to make game-related purchases to improve monetization and engagment. Additionally, predicting receptivity to newsletter can increase brand trust as recieving irrelevant emails can irritate customers. "
